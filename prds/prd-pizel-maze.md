Creating the PRD following the template structure:

Created a PRD for PixelMaze following the template. It includes:

- **Summary**: 12 assumptions covering technical constraints, scope, and user environment
- **Tech Stack**: Phaser 3.80.1, Vite, TypeScript with explicit versions
- **User Roles**: Single Player role with permissions
- **Data Model**: GameState, HighScore, Settings, and MazeData entities with relationships
- **Core Features**: 8 features (Main Menu, Maze Generation, Movement, Coin Collection, Timer & Exit, HUD, Camera) with exact UI copy, hex colors, error states, and acceptance checks
- **UI/UX**: 9 hex color codes, pixel font typography, desktop layout notes
- **Out of Scope**: 12 explicitly excluded features
- **Success Criteria**: 12 checkmarked testable criteria

The PRD addresses all clarifications: procedural 21x21 mazes, smooth pixel movement, timer-based win/lose, coin scoring, keyboard controls, and future-proofing for camera following and enemies. All UI text, colors, and error messages are specified with exact strings and hex codes.
