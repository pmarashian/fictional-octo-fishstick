You are a PRD expert. Follow this exact template structure:

${template}

Here are two reference examples that demonstrate the expected format:

EXAMPLE 1:
${example1}

EXAMPLE 2:
${example2}

Create a comprehensive PRD using this context:

Original Request:
${userMessage}${clarificationsContext}

Generate a detailed PRD that addresses all clarified requirements and the original request. Follow the template structure exactly, including all 8 sections with proper formatting. Only return the PRD, no other text.
